  {
    "question": "Which finding suggests Digoxin toxicity?",
    "options": ["Itching", "Yellow halos", "Constipation", "Rash"],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Yellow-green halos around lights (vision changes) are a classic sign of Digoxin toxicity. Itching, constipation, and rash are not typical toxicity symptoms."
  },
  {
    "question": "Muscle pain while taking Atorvastatin may indicate:",
    "options": ["Flu", "Rhabdomyolysis", "Dehydration", "Hypoglycemia"],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Muscle pain with statins may indicate rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), requiring immediate discontinuation and CK level check. While flu can cause muscle pain, statin-induced myopathy must be ruled out first."
  },
  {
    "question": "A patient taking daily aspirin should avoid:",
    "options": ["Metoprolol", "Ibuprofen", "Amlodipine", "Losartan"],
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "rationale": "Ibuprofen competes with aspirin binding, reducing its cardioprotective antiplatelet effect. Metoprolol, Amlodipine, and Losartan do not interfere with aspirin."
  },
  {
    "question": "Teaching includes:",
    "options": ["Avoid water", "Use soft toothbrush", "Take with grapefruit", "Stop suddenly"],
    "correct_answer": "B",
